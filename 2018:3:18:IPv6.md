# IPv6

## Primary changes from IPv4
- Expanded addressing Capabilities
- Header format simplification
- Improved support for extensiosn and options
- Flow label Capability

Documentation: [RFC2460](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2460.txt)


In short, IPv6 basically consists of an IPv6 header, then numerous optional extension headers appended after it, each serves different purposes and information.

Here are some of the main headers discussed in [RFC2460](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2460.txt) and what I found interesting in their protocol:

## IPv6 Extension Headers
The contents and semantics of each header determines whether or not to proceed to the next header. Therefore, they must be processed strictly in the order they appear in the packet.

There is a *recommended* extension layer order for each packet, but nodes are required to process extension headers in any order, with an exception that Hop-by-hop header must follow immediately after the IPv6 header.


### Hop-by-Hop Options header
The Hop-by-Hop Options header contains information that must be examined and processed by every node along a packet's delivery path. It **must** immediately follow the IPv6 header.

### Destination Options header
For options to be processed by the first destination that appears in the IPv6 destination address field plus subsequent destinations listed in the next header (Used before routing header or Upper-layer header).

### Routing (Type 0) header
The routing header contains a vector of addresses to route to after the packet has arrived to the destination (probably a router). Assuming that the packet is in the correct format (and parameters). The router node should masquerade the packet's destination address with the addresses in the routing header, and send it through another interface.

### Fragment header
The fragment header is used by an IPv6 source to send a packet larger than it would fit in the path MTU to its destination. Different to IPv4, this process is done purely on the source side.


## Packet Size Issues
IPv6 requires that every link in the internet have a MTU of 1280 octets or greater. It is recommended to have MTU greater than 1500 octets, to accommodate possible encapsulation (i.e., tunnelling) without incurring IPv6-layer fragmentation.

Path MTU Discovery [RFC-1981] is beneficial for nodes implementing IPv6.

## Flow Labels
The 20-bit flow label in the IPv6 header is used by a source to label sequences of packets for which it requests special handling by the IPv6 routers, such as non-default quality of service or "real-time" service.

## Traffic Classes
The 8-bit traffic class field in the IPv6 is used for originating nodes and/or forwarding routers to identify and distinguish between different classes or priorities of IPv6 packets.

## Upper-layer checksums Issue
Any transport or other uppper-layer protocol that includes the addresses from the IP header in its checksum computation must be modified for use over IPv6.

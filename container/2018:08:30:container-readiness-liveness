Kubernetes provides liveness and readiness probes, which means it sens http requests to a pod periodically, if the pod is not running (e.g. in a deadlock), it will kill the pod and start a new one. If the pod is not ready, the pod will not be available as a service endpoint, and no traffic will be sent to the pod.

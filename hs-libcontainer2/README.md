GraphQL Demo
===============

This is a demo of using GraphQL with a Haskell API backend. In this case we use Yesod. Or yesod wai to make it all work. We may not be able to use yesod if it doesn't cleanly integrate. Alternatively something lighterweight like soctty would be better.

Note the use of transient haskell as well to do weird things.

Note the use of warp with WAI.

# CGO


`import "C"`provides a reference to C's namespace, `"C"` is not a real module, but simply a special name for cgo to interpret.


## Preambles and Directives

Preambles may contain any C code, including function and variable declarations and definitions. However *static variables* in the preamble may not be referenced from GO code. static functions are permitted.

The `#cgo` directives are used to provide flags for the compiler and linker when building parts of the package, they are represented by any lines starting with `#cgo` followed by a space.

The `//export ` directive is used to make Go functions accessible to C code.

[More on #cgo directives and available flags](https://golang.org/cmd/cgo/)

## String conversion

String conversion functions such as `C.CString`, `C.GoString` and `C.GoStringN` makes a copy of the string data.

C.CString returns a pointer to the start of the char array in the heap memory. This address `cs` must be freed using `C.free(unsafe.Pointer(cs))` after usage. It is common to defer this operation just after allocation as such:

```go
cs := C.CString(s)
defer C.free(unsafe.Pointer(cs))
```

## Compilation
When Go tool sees `import "C"`, it will look for other non-Go files in the directory and compile them as part of the Go package.

## Go References to C
C's struct field names that are **keywords** in Go can be accessed by prefixing them with an underscore. If x points at a C struct with a field name "type", `x._type` accesses the field. For non-keywords, they are simply `x.type`. C struct fields that cannot be expressed in Go, such as bit fields or misaligned data, are omitted in the Go struct.

Standard numeric types are available under:
```go
C.char
C.schar (signed char)
C.uchar (unsigned char)
C.short
C.ushort
C.int
C.uint
C.long
C.ulong
C.longlong
C.ulonglong
C.float
C.double
C.complexfloat
C.complexdouble

unsafe.Pointer (void*)

```

To access a struct, union or enum type directly, prefix it with `struct_`, `union_` or `enum_`. Size of any C type `T` is available as `C.sizeof_T`.

```
C.struct_stat (is of type struct stat)
C.sizeof_struct_state
```

Go doesn't have support for C's union type in the general case, they are represented as a Go byte array with the same length.

Go structs cannot embed fields with C types.

## Passing pointers
Passing pointers between Go/C is complicated due to garbage collection in Go.

Here we refer to **Go pointers** as pointer to memory allocated by Go. Both the `&` operator and the `new` function causes Go to allocate memory. And **C pointers** are pointers allocated by C (such as C.malloc).

A pointer type may hold a Go pointer or a C pointer. Note that some Go types *always* include Go pointers, such as string, slice, interface, channel, map and function types.

### Calling C from Go
- Go code may pass a Go pointer to C provided that the Go memory it points to **does not contain any Go pointers**.
- C code may not keep a copy of a Go pointer after the call returns.

### Calling Go from C
- A Go function called by C code may not return a Go pointer (which implies it may not return a string, slice, channel and so forth).
- A Go function called by C code may take a Go pointer as an argument, but it must preserve the property that the Go memory to which it points to does not contain any Go pointers.
- Go code may not store Go pointer in C memory at any time.

The rules are checked dynamically at runtime. The checking is controlked by `$GODEBUG` env variable, `1` implements reasonaly cheap dynamic check, checks are disabled entirely by setting the variable to `0`. Complete checking of pointer handling is available by setting it to `2`.

It is possible to break these rules via unsafe package, but programs that violates the rules are likely to fail in unexpected ways.

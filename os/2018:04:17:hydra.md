# Hydra
Hydra is a CI/CD software built on top of the Nix package manager. It is an automated system which continuously or periodically checks out the source code of a project, builds it, runs tests, and produce reports for the developers.

Simply put, it performs the following tasks:
1. Obtains latest source code from a version management system.
2. Runs component's build process
3. Presents the results of the build

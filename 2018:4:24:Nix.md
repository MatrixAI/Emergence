# Nix

# Philosophy and Goals
- Correct deployments: Deterministic behaviour given configuration.
- Manageability: dependency interference. Rollbacks.

# Important Properties
- Immutable dependencies
  - Problem: Some dependencies require mutable states
- Content addressability at suitable places
- Declarative Nix expression
- Atomic, allow rollbacks

# Implementation Difficulties and Solutions
## Changing runtime dependencies in compiled binary
PatchELF to replace runtime dependency links. `sed` can be used for hardcoded static links.

## Nix derivation expressions
An example Nix Derivation Expression
```
{stdenv, fetchurl, perl}:

stdenv.mkDerivation {
	name = "hello-2.1.1";
	builder = "./builder.sh";
	src = fetchurl {
		url = http://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/hello/hello-2.1.1.tar.gz;
		md5 = "70c9ccf9fac07f762c24f2df2290784d";
	};
	inherit perl;
}
```

The result of this function is a derivation - a component build action which derives the component from its inputs. `mkDerivation` is a function provided by `stdenv` that builds a component from a set of attributes.

If the `build` attribute is not specified, `mkDerivation` will use the standard Unix approach (`configure; make; make install`).

Example builder:
```
source $stdenv/setup
PATH=$perl/bin/:$PATH
tar xvfz $src
cd hello-*
./configure --prefix=$out
make
make install
```

When Nix runs the builder, it initially clears all environment variables (except for the attributes declared in the derivation). This prevents undeclared inputs. `$stdenv` points to the location of the standard environment being used, `$perl` points to location of the Perl interpreter. `$src` points to the location in Nix stroe to which the distribution was downloaded. `$out` is the location where the the component will eventually be stored in the Nix store. This means before the build script is ran, the component's hash would've been computed already.

Nix expressions are hard to be identified via a cryptographic hash due to scatter of languages and imports. For these reasons nix expressions are translated to a more primitive language *store derivatives*, which encodes single component build actions.

Store derivations are placed in the Nix store, and as such have a store path too. The store derivations each have an unique identification of objects of source deployment, just as path of binary components uniquely identify objects of binary deployment.

An example Store derivation:
```
{ output = "/nix/store/hashhashhash-hello-2.1.1",
  inputDrvs = {
    "/nix/store/hashhashhash-bash-3.0.drv",
    "/nix/store/hashahshhash-hello-2.1.1.tar.gz.drv",
    "/nix/store/hashhashhash-stdenv-linux.drv",
  },
  inputSrcs = {"/nix/store/abcabcabc-builder.sh"},
  system = "i686-linux",
  builder = "/nix/store/hashhashhash-bahs-3.0/bin/sh",
  args = ["-e", "/nix/store/abcabcabc-builder.sh"],
  envVars = {
    {"builder", "/nix/store/hashahshahs-bash-3.0/bin/bash"},
    {"name", "hello-2.1.1"}
    {"out", "/nix/store/hashhashhash-hello-2.1.1"}
    {"perl", "/nix/store/hashahshahs-perl-5.8.6"}
    ...
  }
}
```

As seen from this example, store derivations contains only sources from the Nix store, this means that every component in the store derivation is content hashed, and hence we can address the store derivation by the hash of its content, which is enough to uniquely identify the context of this derivation.

To be able to content address the Nix Expression that builds a container image, we might want to use `nix-instantiate` to produce the store derivation of the nix derivation expression, then use the content hash of the store derivation to address the artifact spec.

# Deploying Nix
After the building stage, nix's runtime dependencies can be seen by querying the closure of one Nix package via `nix-store -qR /nix/store/<binary-path>`. These dependencies are pointed by the binary that we are deploying.

To perform actual software deployment, it is necessary to get the Nix expressions to the client machines. At the current stage, matrix is only using x86 running NixOS, so it isn't a problem. But what if at a later stage each node will have a very different architecture? We will need to have some ways to calculate the content hash of a build action without the need of deploying it to the target machine just yet. Update: Nix mkDerivation expression already contains an attribute `system`, which means this expression should be deployed only in this particular architecture. Hence the store paths should remain the same.

## Translating Nix expressions to Store derivations
`nix-instantiate` takes a nix expression and evaluates it to normal form. The normal form should be a call to derivation, or a nested structure of lists and attribute sets that contain calls to derivation. Then these derivation nix expressions are subsequently translated to store expressions again.

To clarify, `nix-instantiate` is a function that translates the arguments attribute set (produced by nix expression) into a store derivation. It:
	1. Computes the store derivation from nix expression
	2. Writes the store derivation in `/nix/store`
	3. Returns the original attribute set, with three more attributes appended:
		- `drvPath` path of the store derivation
		- `outPath` output Path of the store derivation
		- `type` set to value `"derivation"`. Distinguishes `derivation and `subderivation during recursive calls.



Abstract syntax of store derivation:

Let `{as}` be the attribute set derived from the derivation nix expression.
```
data StoreDrv = StoreDrv {
  output: Path,			# store derivation hash, initally an empty string
  outputHash: String,		# content address of fixed-output derivation ()
  outputHashAlgo: String,
  inputDrvs: [Path],
  inputSrcs: [Path],
  system: String,
  builder: Path,
  args: [String],
  envVars: [(String, String)]
}
```
- output is the content address of the final product in the nix store. It reflects all information that goes into the derivation. The final output path is also placed in `$out` for the builder.
- envVars are computed

### Translation Algorithm

Let `processBinding` be a function that takes in a nix expression `e` and produce a set `{drvs = { }, srcs = { }, res = { }}` where `drvs` is a set of store derivation paths in the expression, `srcs` are store path for sources in the expression, and `res` are a set of strings that represent the normal form of the nix expression.

The algorithm for `nix-instantiate` is shown as follows:

```
instantiate(as): # Where as is the attribute set from derivation
	name = eval(as.name)
	if name ends in ".drv" abort
	if name contains invalid characters abort
	d = StoreDrv {
		output = "" # Empty string
		outputHash = eval(as.outputHash) if attr. exists otherwise ""
		outputHashAlgo = ""
		inputDrvs = {processsBinding(e).drvs | (n = e) in as}
		inputSrcs = {inputSrcs = processBinding(e).srcs | (n = e) in as}
		system = eval(as.system) # must be a string
		builder = concSpec(processBinding(as.builder).res)
		args = map(\e.processBinding(e).res, as.args)
		envVars = {(n, concSp(processBinding(e).res)) | (n = e) in as} union {(out, "")}
	}
	d.output = makePath("output:out", hashDrv(d), name))
	d.envVars["out"] = d.output
	p = addToStore(printDrv(d), d.inputDrvs union d.input, name + ".drv")
	return {outPath = d.output, drvPath = p}
```

Now let's go through this line by line.

1. instantiate is a function that takes in as, where as is the attribute set from nix derivation.
2. `name` will evaluate to the name of the derivation for example `hello-2.0`
3. Now we begin to structure our Store Derivation attribute set:
	- output is originally an empty string
	- outputHash is ...
	- inputDrvs will be obtained by going through everything in `as`, and running `processBinding` on it.
	  (processBinding's pseudocode is on page 103 of the thesis)
		- This will make sure all paths in `as` are added to the nix store by their content
		- return the `.drvs` of all *derivations* found in the `as`.
		- Otherwise flatten nested lists if there are any, then return the derivations if in list.
	- inputSrcs does similar things as inputDrvs, except this time we are getting the `srcs` produced.
	  	- srcs are produced when `e` is a path, the store path will be returned.
		- Otherwise, if there are lists, flatten it and return the sources found.
	- system is simply the `system` attribute in the derivation attribute set.
	- builder has two parts:
		1. take in all `res` from the `e` supplied, this gives the normal form of the nix expression, such as `true` evaluate to `"1` and false evaluate to `""` and etc. In case of an derivation, res returns the evaluated `as.outPath`, `outPath` is the eventual location of there the output of the derivation will be stored, it is initially set to `""`, then  

### Calculating the store paths
Nix store is a directory contains file system objects (FSOs) such as software components, user environments and store derivations.

The operation `addToStore(fso, refs, name)` adds an FSO to the Nix store. `ref` contains the references entry for the resulting path, and will be used to update the corredponding referrer mapping in the result path.

```bash
addToStore(fso, refs, name):
	h = hash(serialise(fso))
	p = makePath("source", h.hexdigest_trunc(), name)
	if p is valid:
		mkdir -p $(p) # somewhere in here references are set
	return p
```

# find out what these things means
- `nix-build` analyse its output and see how to build it from scratch
  - how are the hashes of the nix expression instructions generated
  - how is the hash of the derived output generated
- see if I can build one for OCI containers - see how docker-tools are done.
- Look into `nix-store` and `nix-build`'s source code
- Even though output is removed, derivation still exists, why is that?
- Investigate runtime closure, build time closure
- .drv hash vs output path hash

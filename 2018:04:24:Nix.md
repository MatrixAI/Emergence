# Nix

# Philosophy and Goals
- Correct deployments: Deterministic behaviour given configuration.
- Manageability: dependency interference. Rollbacks.

# Important Properties
- Immutable dependencies
  - Problem: Some dependencies require mutable states
- Content addressability at suitable places
- Declarative Nix expression

# Implementation
- PatchELF to replace runtime dependency links. `sed` can be used for hardcoded static links.


Nix expressions are hard to be identified via a cryptographic hash due to scatter of languages and imports.
Hence Nix derivation expressions are translated recursively into a lower level *store derivations* for smaller components. This is usually done automatically through `nix-env` but can be done manually through `nix-instantiate`.

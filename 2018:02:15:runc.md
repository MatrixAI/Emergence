# Create Container
- `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` is a environment variable set when you log in, tells any program
1. Creates a container rooting at `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/runc` if user isn't root, otherwise at `/run/runc`.

Usage: create <container-id>
Flags:
  - `bundle, b`, `console-socket`, `pid-file`, `no-pivot`, `no-new-keyring`, `preserve-fds`
  - `ramfs` is a filesystem storing Linux's disk caches.
  - `ramdisk` is an older and less optimal version of ramfs.
  - `tmpfs` is a derivative of `ramfs` which uses dynamically assigned memory and allows VMs to free its space, as well as using the swap space.
  - `rootfs` is a special instance of `ramfs` (or `tmpfs` if enabled) used in `initram`.
  - `no-pivot` should be used whenever the `rootfs` is on top of a `ramdisk`.

## Creation process

1. Create a libcontainer with configurations including `cgroupname`
1. Condition checking and validation of arguments and configs
1. View the stat of the specified `containerRoot` (e.g. `/runc/container_id` if allowed).
1. If the containerRoot exists, then raise exception
1. Otherwise, create `containerRoot` and change the UID and GID of `containerRoot` to the current process's UIDs and GID.
1. Create a linuxContainter struct with various config and path attributes.
1. Create a cgroup manager
  - `Apply`, `GetPids`, `GetAllPids`, `GetStats`, `Freeze`, `Destroy`, `getPaths`
1. Create a Intel RDT manager if intelrdt is enabled.
1. Set container state to `stoppedState` (container state is an interface consisting functions: `transition`, `destroy`, `status`)
1. Return container.

## CgroupManager Interface
**Apply**
Applies cgroup config to the process with the specified pid

**GetPids**
Returns the PIDs inside the cgroup set

**GetAllPids**
Returns the PIDs inside the cgroup set & all sub-cgroups

**GetStats**
Returns statistics for the cgroup set

**Freeze**
Toggles the freezer cgroup according with the specified state

**Destroy**
Destroy the cgroup set

**GetPaths**
Returns cgroup paths to save in a state and to be able to restore the object later.

**Set**
Set the cgroup as configured.

## Rootless Containers
Containers that are created by unprivileged user.

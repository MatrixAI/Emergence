# Artifact Parser

There are two main goals of an Artifact Parser
- Be able to produce a deterministic output from a Artifact declaration.
- Be able to produce a "filesystem bundle" from the deterministic output.

# Questions
- What are the QoS constraints, are any of them related to cgroups/security modules?
	- Yes.


# Discussions

The filesystem bundle may need to be modified upon parsing other part of the Architect language, and the orchestrator at runtime. For example the state spec may introduce more mount points that needs to be included in the runtime config, and cgroup resource allocation may be specified outside of the Automaton spec.


We need to investigate whether it makes sense to include persistent storage and other *node specific* properties in the artifact spec. The deterministic output of the artifact spec should be **portable**. This means any node specific properties (e.g. GPU mounts in nodes which has GPUs) should not be part of the deterministic output. 

I'm also unsure of whether excluding such properties could be harmful towards the intension of having deterministic outputs.

My next steps would be to study OCI image spec further, figure out what Volume refers to in the OCI image config, and what other properties do we need to include in Artifact specification.

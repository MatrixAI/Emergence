# Go Structs

Go structs have some sort of inheritance, but child structs will only inherit **functions** from the parent struct, not the data.

The syntax looks like this:

```go
type Parent struct {
	a int // Parent's field, inaccessible by Child
}

type Child struct {
	Parent // Inherit Parent
	b int // Child's field
}
```

We can *upcast* a Parent struct to a Child struct (if it was initialised as the child but passed as Parent).

```go
// Upcast children -> parent
func foo(p *ParentInterface) {
	c := (*p).(*Child)
	fmt.Println(c.b)
}
```

# Interface vs Struct

Go interfaces maintains a pointer to a struct.

Hence it is never really necessary to be passing pointer to interfaces, as they are pointers themselves.

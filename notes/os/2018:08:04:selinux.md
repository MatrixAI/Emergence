# SELinux

A Security Enhancement to Linux which allow users and admins more control over access control.

Access can be constrained on such variable as which users and applications can access which resoruce. These resources may take the form of files. Stand Linux Access controls, such as file modes are modifiable by the user and the applications which the user runs. Conversely, SeLinux access controls are determined by a policy loaded on the system which may not be changed by careless user or misbehaving applications.

Except for the usual rwe, SELinux also allows unlink, append only, move a file and so on. It also allows users to specify access to object other than files, e.g. IPC.

1. SELinux can confine an application within its own domain, and allow it to have the minimum privileges required to do its job.
2. SELinux will stop actions against the policy.
3. If a policy "confined" the application and data, even if the application deletes all files due to virus/malicious usage, the data should still be there.
4. User login sessions can be confined to their own domains.
5. SELinux provide sanboxing services for applications that needs full resoruces.
6. SELinux will not stop memory leaks or buffer over-runs. However damage can be contained.
7. New rules can be added using `audit2allow(1)`, however this can open holes.

# Rlimit

```c
#include <sys/time.h>
#include <sys/resource.h>

int getrlimit(int resource, struct rlimit *rlim);
int setrlimit(int resource, const struct rlimit *rlim);

int prlimit(pid_t pid, int resource, const struct rlimit *new_limit,
            struct rlimit *old_limit);
```

`getrlimit()` and `setrlimit()` syscalls get and set resource limits respectively. Each resource has an associated soft and hard limit, as defined:

```c
struct rlimit {
	rlim_t rlim_cur; // soft limit
	rlim_t rlim_max; // hard limit
}
```

Soft limit is the value that the kernel enforces for the corresponding resources. Hard limit is the ceiling for the soft limit.

A unprivileged process may set only its soft limit to a value in the range from 0 up to hard limit, and (irreversibly) lower its hard limit.

A privileged process (one with `CAP_SYS_RESOURCE` in the initial user namesapce) may take arbitrary changes to either limit value.

The value `RLIM_INFINITY` denotes no limit on a resource.

`resource` denotes which resuorce the limit will be applied on.

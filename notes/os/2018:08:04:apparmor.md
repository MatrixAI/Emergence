# AppArmor

AppArmor is a Mandatory Access Control (MAC) system which is a kernel (LSM) enhancement to confine programs to a limited set of resources.

- MAC: type of access control which the OS contrains the ability of a *subject* or *initiator* to access or generally perform some sort of operation on an *object* or *target*.

AppArmor is used to bind access control attributes to progarms rather than users. It is provided via *profiles* loaded into the kernel, typically at boot. AppArmor can be in one of two modes: enforcement and complain. Profiles loaded in enforcement mode will result in enforcement of the policy defined in the profile as well as reporting policy violation attempts (either via syslog or auditd). Profiles in complain mode will not enforce policy but instead report policy violation attempts.

AppArmor differs from some other MAC systems on Linux; It is path-based, it allows mixing of enforcement and complain mode profiles, it uses include files to ease development, and it has a far lower barrier to entry than other popular MAC systems.

Example profile, from `/etc/apparmor.d/usr.sbin.tcpdump` on Ubuntu 9.04:

```
#include <tunables/global>

/usr/sbin/tcpdump {
  #include <abstractions/base>
  #include <abstractions/nameservice>
  #include <abstractions/user-tmp>

  capability net_raw,
  capability setuid,
  capability setgid,
  capability dac_override,
  network raw,
  network packet,

  # for -D
  capability sys_module,
  @{PROC}/bus/usb/ r,
  @{PROC}/bus/usb/** r,

  # for -F and -w
  audit deny @{HOME}/.* mrwkl,
  audit deny @{HOME}/.*/ rw,
  audit deny @{HOME}/.*/** mrwkl,
  audit deny @{HOME}/bin/ rw,
  audit deny @{HOME}/bin/** mrwkl,
  @{HOME}/ r,
  @{HOME}/** rw,

  /usr/sbin/tcpdump r,
}
```
